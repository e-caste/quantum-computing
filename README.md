### Jupyter notebooks to understand practical quantum computing

## Quantum Entanglement

This Jupyter notebook contains the actual Python code to demonstrate quantum entanglement on a real IBM quantum computer.

You can see the results already present in the notebook here on Github, or you can clone the repo and run it on your own.  
For that, you'll need `python3.7`, its pip dependencies `qiskit qiskit-ibmq-provider jupyterlab` and IBM-Q account.

## Quantum Teleportation

This Jupyter notebook, like the one above, contains real runnable Python code to demonstrate the quantum teleportation process and how to use it to "copy" a qubit to another one, without making it collapse during the "copying" process.
