### Jupyter notebooks to understand practical quantum computing

## quantum_entanglement.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook contains the actual Python code to demonstrate quantum entanglement on a real IBM quantum computer.

You can see the results already present in the notebook here on Github, or you can clone the repo and run it on your own.  
For that, you'll need `python3.7`, its pip dependencies `qiskit qiskit-ibmq-provider jupyterlab` and IBM-Q account.
